# MyLinkedList

Welcome to the **MyLinkedList**! This program now leverages a **LinkedList** algorithm to optimize the storage and sorting of numbers provided by the user.

- **Code Reuse with `LinkedList` and `Collections.sort()`**: 
  - `Collections.sort()` is used to efficiently sort the Stack, utilizing the **Timesort** algorithm for improved performance.

## ‚ú® Program Features
- **User Input Handling**: Accepts a list of numbers from the user and stores them in ascending order.
- **Sorting Algorithm**: The use of `Collections.sort()` ensures optimal sorting performance for various input sizes.
- **Code Reuse**: The program demonstrates good practices in code reuse and modular design, making the codebase clean and maintainable.
